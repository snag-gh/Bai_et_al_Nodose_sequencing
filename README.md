This is a reanalysis of the publicly available single cell sequencing of the nodose ganglia (GSE138651) (Bai L, Mesgarzadeh S, Ramesh KS, Huey EL, Liu Y, Gray LA, Aitken TJ, Chen Y, Beutler LR, Ahn JS, Madisen L, Zeng H, Krasnow MA, Knight ZA. Genetic Identification of Vagal Sensory Neurons That Control Feeding. Cell. 2019 Nov 14;179(5):1129-1143.e23. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.031. PMID: 31730854; PMCID: PMC6916730.). The dataset includes SmartSeq2 sequencing of vagal sensory neurons labeled using retrograde tracing from various abdominal gut regions and 10x sequencing of whole nodose ganglia. The integrated clusters were labeled as subdiaphragmatic or supradiaphragmatic. 

Goals : 
1. What are the top genes for the vagal neurons innervating the different sub diaphragmatic regions?
2. How well does the proteomic data for the Gastric region correspond to the single cell profile of the subdiaphragmatic region?
